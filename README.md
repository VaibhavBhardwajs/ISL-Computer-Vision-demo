# Hand Gesture Recognition for Indian Sign Language and Digits

This project uses computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures corresponding to both the Indian Sign Language (ISL) alphabet and numeric digits. The model is trained to classify hand signs into their respective alphabetic characters (A-Z) and digits (1-9), allowing real-time recognition through webcam input.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses the webcam to capture hand gestures and recognize them in real-time.
- **[Indian Sign Language (ISL) Alphabet and Digits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathumarikeri/indian-sign-language-isl)**: Recognizes and classifies hand signs into letters A-Z and digits 1-9.
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking to extract hand landmarks for gesture classification.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Employs a Random Forest Classifier for gesture prediction.
